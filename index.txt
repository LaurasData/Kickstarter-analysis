# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
- An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns data for trends by goals, outcomes and launch dates.

### Purpose
- Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

- created pivot tables and graphing in Excel to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date
--Grouped "Row Labels" by months in the Pivot table
--Created Year() from Conversion date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-Creating the converation dates and years in the pivot tables was resolved by referring to microsoft support for Countifs(), Years() and converstions. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
--While there are 839 successful theater campains, the months of May and June have the highest rates of sucessfully campaigns
--Conversely, While there are 37 canceled  Kickstarter campaigns, the month of Jan has the highest cancelaton rates.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
--While there are 1047 Kickstarter plays, none were canceled.
--While there are 694 successfull Kickstarter plays, over 85% grossed less then $5000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
--Moving and renaming formulas was time consumming

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

--Creating a Box and Whiskers graph can show the outliers for this dataset
--Creating a Stacked Bar graph will how the proportional comparisions
