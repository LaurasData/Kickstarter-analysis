# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose
- Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

- Created pivot tables and grouping in Excel to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date and funding goals
- Grouped "Row Labels" by months in the Pivot table
- Created Year() from Conversion date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Created the converation dates and years in the pivot tables was resolved by referring to microsoft support for Countifs(), Years() and converstions.
- Microsoft docs and overstock provided formulas 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    A. Moving and renaming formulas was time consumming

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    A.Creating a Box and Whiskers graph can show the outliers for this dataset
    B.Creating a Stacked Bar graph will how the proportional comparisions
